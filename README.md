## 🔐 Private RCM Projects (Selected Work)

While some of my current work is in private repositories, I want to highlight the focus areas I’m actively contributing to in **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)**. These projects represent my ongoing exploration of AI, automation, and healthcare payment workflows:

- **revintel-mcp** ![Private Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/repo-private-red?style=flat-square)  
  *AI-native server designed to help healthcare organizations shift from reactive to proactive revenue cycle management.*

- **hcc-revenue-intelligence-mvp** ![Private Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/repo-private-red?style=flat-square)  
  *Prototype HCC MCP server to surface risk adjustment and revenue leakage insights.*

- **claim-denial-prevention-mvp** ![Private Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/repo-private-red?style=flat-square)  
  *Proof-of-concept engine for claim denial prediction using payer-specific rules and ERA-labeled training data.*

---

📝 *These repositories are private, but they showcase my focus on solving RCM challenges such as claim scrubbing, denial prevention, HCC revenue intelligence, and AI-driven automation within ambulatory healthcare IT.*

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
