## 🔐 Private RCM Projects (Selected Work)

While some of my work lives in private repositories, here are the core systems I’m actively building today under the **ContextRCM** umbrella — focused on shift-left denial prevention, ERA-driven intelligence, and AI-assisted revenue cycle automation.

Although the initial pilots are in **Behavioral Health**, the architecture is fully specialty-agnostic and can extend to primary care, multi-specialty, surgical groups, and other ambulatory settings.

- **npi-intelligence-graph** ![Private Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/repo-private-red?style=flat-square)  
  End-to-end NPI analytics and knowledge-graph engine running on my DGX-Sparc workstation.  
  Transforms the national NPI registry into market intelligence and targeted lead-generation across any specialty.

- **context-rcm-rules-engine** ![Private Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/repo-private-red?style=flat-square)  
  Unified rules engine combining CMS policy (NCCI, MUE, LCD/MCD), payer-specific quirks, and dynamic ERA-based behavior patterns to power shift-left denial prevention across specialties.

- **context-rcm-denial-intelligence** ![Private Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/repo-private-red?style=flat-square)  
  ERA-driven denial clustering, preventability scoring, and “What-if” pre-submission simulation.  
  Core engine for proactive denial prevention in ambulatory workflows — not limited to BH.

- **context-rcm-underpayment-detector** ![Private Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/repo-private-red?style=flat-square)  
  Statistical reconstruction of payer fee schedules using ERA payments.  
  Detects silent underpayments, shortfalls, and contract leakage for any CPT/modifier set.

📝 *These repositories are private, but together they form the backbone of the ContextRCM mission: a proactive, intelligence-driven approach to ambulatory revenue cycle management — reducing denials, reconstructing fee schedules, enabling clean claims on first submission, and scaling across specialties with transparent, data-driven insight.*
